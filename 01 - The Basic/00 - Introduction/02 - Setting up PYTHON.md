For setting up Python we need a few things.
 - An IDE (Integrated development environment)
 - Download the Python Language
 - Start Programming

For the first one we can use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/pycharm/).

For the second one we need to go to oficcial [Python](https://www.python.org) page, click **Downloads** and install the last version.

And then you are ready for start programming
